Motion recognition projects often encounter challenges such as complex hyperparameter tuning, diverse dataset formats, and the integration of heterogeneous data sources. Achieving optimal recognition accuracy while automating model construction, evaluation, and deployment remains a significant hurdle.

This library addresses these challenges by simplifying the processes of model training, evaluation, AutoMR, and deployment. It offers an end-to-end, modular architecture designed for seamless customization and extension, enabling efficient handling of multi-source datasets and delivering superior recognition accuracy.

## Features
- **Customized Dataset:** Alternative options for your personalized object recognition dataset.
- **Modular Design:** Easily formalized and extensible components, such as data loaders, models, and optimizers, providing flexibility for customization and seamless integration into diverse workflows.
- **Multi-GPU Support:** Efficiently train models on multiple GPUs using distributed training strategies.
- **Logging and Visualization:** Integrated logging and visualization tools for monitoring training progress.
- **Real-time Evaluation and Save:** Provide real-time classification report and confusion matrix for full-scope evaluation of the recognition, the best accuracy and model will be saved after the training.
- **Easy Deployment:** Seamlessly deploy quanitzed models into designated hardwares.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Built-in support for hyperparameter tuning, optimization and automl.
